# odin-restaurant-page

The purpose of this project is to build a restaurant page using DOM manipulation and to practice using JS modules and bundling them with Webpack.

In the early stages of development, the HTML page will be hardcoded, but with further commits the JS file should generate the whole HTML file by itself.
